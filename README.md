Walk around with A/D or Left/Right, jump with Space, 
pick up Trash with right mouse button, throw it in the air with right mouse button,
hold and release left mouse button to power up your tyre iron swing

As usual - it's an LD game, so it's going to be pretty _raw_.

All in all... reasonably happy with the visual treatment. It's got a vaguely "Saul Bass" feel to it.
