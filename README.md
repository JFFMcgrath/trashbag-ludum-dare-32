"Trashbag" - a game made with Unity for Ludum Dare 32
Theme: "An Unconventional Weapon"

Walk around with A/D or Left/Right, jump with Space, 
pick up Trash with right mouse button, throw it in the air with right mouse button,
hold and release left mouse button to power up your tyre iron swing

Waste the wasters by launching Trash into their faces

Semi-rhyming inadvertent line, right there

As usual - it's an LD game, so it's going to be pretty _raw_. 
I remember excruciating over what exactly I was going to make.

All in all... reasonably happy with the visual treatment. It's got a vaguely "Saul Bass" feel to it.
